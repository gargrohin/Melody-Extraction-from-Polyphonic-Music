## Jupyter Notebooks

###### Used for experiments and Prototyping. Not needed to run the code.

##### To-Do

- Comment the notebooks. 
- Delete the copies if not needed.

The notebooks can (should) be used to see hoe to create the plots, What different values for the experiments were tried, etc. Since they were used for prototyping, I wasn't able to maintain the structure of individual notebooks, though I have tried to use separate notebooks for different experiments as evident (or not) throught their names.
