This folder was created while cleaning the code. You won't see the path to the folder in any code. 

The files here are the predefined **WF0** and **WGamma** matrices used by the NMF algorithm. These matrices were created using a gaussian distribution in one of the notebooks. They can be visualised also using one of the notebooks (probably the same one).
